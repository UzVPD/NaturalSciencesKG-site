          Terms & Conditions By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply
          to you ‚Äì you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app.
          You‚Äôre not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in
          any way. You‚Äôre not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also
          shouldn‚Äôt try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The
          app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual
          property rights related to it, still belong to Vladislav Pak. Vladislav Pak is committed
          to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
          reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time
          and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it
          very clear to you exactly what you‚Äôre paying for. The NaturalSciencesKG app stores and
          processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide my Service. It‚Äôs
          your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore
          recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing
          software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your
          device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
          compromise your phone‚Äôs security features and it could mean that the NaturalSciencesKG app
          won‚Äôt work properly or at all. You should be aware that there are certain things that
          Vladislav Pak will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require
          the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by
          your mobile network provider, but Vladislav Pak cannot take responsibility for the app not
          working at full functionality if you don‚Äôt have access to Wi-Fi, and you don‚Äôt have any of
          your data allowance left. If you‚Äôre using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
          should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will
          still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data
          for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges.
          In using the app, you‚Äôre accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming
          data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country)
          without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which
          you‚Äôre using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission
          from the bill payer for using the app. Along the same lines, Vladislav Pak cannot always
          take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your
          device stays charged ‚Äì if it runs out of battery and you can‚Äôt turn it on to avail the
          Service, Vladislav Pak cannot accept responsibility. With respect to Vladislav Pak‚Äôs
          responsibility for your use of the app, when you‚Äôre using the app, it‚Äôs important to bear
          in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times,
          we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available
          to you. Vladislav Pak accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you
          experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app. At some point,
          we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on iOS ‚Äì the requirements
          for system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app
          to) may change, and you‚Äôll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app.
          Vladislav Pak does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant
          to you and/or works with the iOS version that you have installed on your device. However,
          you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also
          wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving
          notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
          rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the
          app, and (if needed) delete it from your device. Changes to This Terms and Conditions I
          may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review
          this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the
          new Terms and Conditions on this page. These terms and conditions are effective as of
          2021-03-02 Contact Us If you have any questions or suggestions about my Terms and
          Conditions, do not hesitate to contact me at vpd.vlad@gmail.com. This Terms and Conditions
